#the main aim of this code is to provide an analysis of the landslide happened in Blatten (CH) in 28th of May 2025
#After a brief visual analysis of the spatial changement produced by the landslide, we will proceed to a more specific analysises such as the condition of the River "Lonza" and a classification of the debris produced


#installing packages needed, in particular terra and raster in order to manage spatial datasets
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("ggplots2")
install.packages("raster")

#importing the libraries 
library(terra)
library(raster)

#setting a working directory to the main folder of the images 
setwd("C:/Users/andre/Desktop/Blatten")
